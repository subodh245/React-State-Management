THING'S I LEARN 

1)In useState i learn that when we call the number we get the copy of it not the number and when we call the array/string It is return by value

2)In useReducer i learn that useReducer is alternative of useState hook and we can use this when the logic is more complex

3) useMemo: useMemo can be used when the data is big and we have to change somthing within that and we can use useMemo when the calulations are bit more complex
   useCallback: useCallback can be used when we have to call the function and dont want to make it globle and we can use it 
   when we are creating a custom hook

4) useEffect: I have used useEffect to make api request , what use effect allow us to do only do this code for once otherwise it will stuck into infinite loop

5) useRef: useRef allow us to avoid unnecessary re renders in ui it is alternative of useState

6) i have made custom hook named as usePokemon() and i have used useEffect for fetching pokemon.json file and instead of doing props drilling i have used context and i learn one new thing that is by '!' we can tell typescript that this function will be always undifined

7) I have learn about useCall back context and custom hooks and I have made pokemon app by using this functions and one thing i learn is we should always use usecall back when we are useing costum hook and for search option I have used useMemo for searching pokemon

8) I have made an multipage app where onclick it will show details of the pokemon and insted of useing useReduccers, useEffect I learn to  use react jquery to manage the data in "indirect pokemon"
