THING'S I LEARN 

1)In useState i learn that when we call the number we get the copy of it not the number and when we call the array/string It is return by value

2)In useReducer i learn that useReducer is alternative of useState hook and we can use this when the logic is more complex

3) useMemo: useMemo can be used when the data is big and we have to change somthing within that and we can use useMemo when the calulations are bit more complex
   useCallback: useCallback can be used when we have to call the function and dont want to make it globle and we can use it 
   when we are creating a custom hook

4) useEffect: I have used useEffect to make api request , what use effect allow us to do only do this code for once otherwise it will stuck into infinite loop
